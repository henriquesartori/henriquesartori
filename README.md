# Henrique Sartori

Full Stack Developer, in love with coding since 9 years old!

I focus on building user-driven solutions (UDD), deeply understanding the core needs of users to deliver efficient applications that provide meaningful experiences.

With extensive experience working within agile methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Kanban), Iâ€™ve successfully navigated diverse tech stacks and databases to create high-quality software.
