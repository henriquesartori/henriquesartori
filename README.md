# Henrique Sartori

Full Stack Developer, in love with coding since 7 years old.

I focus on creating solutions that are truly user-driven (UDD), aiming to understand the core needs of users and deliver efficient applications that provide a meaningful experience.

I also have long term expertise working under agile methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Kanban) with plenty different tech stacks and databases.
